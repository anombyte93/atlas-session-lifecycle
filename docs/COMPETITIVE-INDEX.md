## Quick Reference: Key Numbers

### Market Opportunity
- **Competitors**: 6 direct/tangential competitors identified
- **Market Size**: Claude Code users actively managing 30+ day projects (estimated 50k-100k globally by 2026)
- **Time Window**: 6-12 months to establish dominance before consolidation
- **Revenue Potential**: $1.2M MRR possible by Q4 2026 with 100 Pro users + 10 Enterprise customers

### Atlas Unique Differentiators
- **Soul purpose tracking**: 100% unique (no competitor has this)
- **Lifecycle management**: 100% unique (only atlas has init → reconcile → settle)
- **Bounty verification**: 95% unique (ralph loop has agents, but not automated verification)
- **File organization**: 100% unique (no competitor touches filesystem)
- **Context harvesting**: 80% unique (memory-mcp has compaction; atlas harvests on closure)
- **5-file memory bank**: 50% unique (competitors have memory, but not this structure)

### Competitive Positioning
- **Claude-Mem**: Competitor in memory space, orthogonal lifecycle
- **memsearch**: Lightweight alternative, no lifecycle
- **memory-mcp**: Advanced memory, no completion mechanism
- **Ralph Loop**: Complementary (could partner, not compete)
- **Generic MCP servers**: Non-competitive (different category)

## The One-Paragraph Summary

Atlas Session Lifecycle is the **project lifecycle engine for Claude Code**. Unlike competitors (Claude-Mem, memsearch, memory-mcp) that solve the memory problem, Atlas solves the completion problem by combining soul purpose tracking, lifecycle management (init → reconcile → settle), objective bounty verification, automatic file organization, and context harvesting. It's the only tool that makes you know when you're done—and proves it. The market is early, the timing is now, and there's a 6-12 month window to establish dominance before consolidation.
